# Medicaid Expansion and Employment Outcomes

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of Medicaid expansion on employment outcomes using regression analysis in Stata. By leveraging the IPUMS database, we identified and analyzed key variables to derive meaningful insights into the relationship between Medicaid expansion and employment.

## Key Features

- Regression analysis using Stata to assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on employment outcomes.
- Used the IPUMS database to source relevant data for analysis.
- Identified and analyzed key variables to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship.

## Project Structure

- `.dta`: Contains the CPS (IPUMS) dataset used for the analysis (too large to upload).
- `.do`: Includes the Stata [.do script](Abbasi_U_Medicaid_Expansion.do) for the regression analysis.
- `.pdf`: Provides detailed [documentation](R_Abbasi_U_Medicaid_Expansion_Project.pdf) explaining the project methodology and findings.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the analysis and explore the findings:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/umerabbasi-git/Medicaid-and-Employment.git`
2. Install Stata and ensure it is added to your system's PATH.
3. Open the [Stata script](Abbasi_U_Medicaid_Expansion.do) and execute it to run the regression analysis.
4. Refer to the [.pdf](R_Abbasi_U_Medicaid_Expansion_Project.pdf) for a comprehensive explanation of the project methodology and findings.
